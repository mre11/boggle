    /// A StringSocket is a wrapper around a Socket.  It provides methods that
    /// asynchronously read lines of text (strings terminated by newlines) and 
    /// write strings. (As opposed to Sockets, which read and write raw bytes.)  
    ///
    /// StringSockets are thread safe.  This means that two or more threads may
    /// invoke methods on a shared StringSocket without restriction.  The
    /// StringSocket takes care of the synchronization.
    /// 
    /// Each StringSocket contains a Socket object that is provided by the client.  
    /// A StringSocket will work properly only if the client refrains from calling
    /// the contained Socket's read and write methods.
    /// 
    /// If we have an open Socket s, we can create a StringSocket by doing
    /// 
    ///    StringSocket ss = new StringSocket(s, new UTF8Encoding());
    /// 
    /// We can write a string to the StringSocket by doing
    /// 
    ///    ss.BeginSend("Hello world", callback, payload);
    ///    
    /// where callback is a SendCallback (see below) and payload is an arbitrary object.
    /// This is a non-blocking, asynchronous operation.  When the StringSocket has 
    /// successfully written the string to the underlying Socket, or failed in the 
    /// attempt, it invokes the callback.  The parameters to the callback are a
    /// (possibly null) Exception and the payload.  If the Exception is non-null, it is

    /// string or the Exception will be non-null, but nor both.  If the string is non-null,
