    /// write strings. (As opposed to Sockets, which read and write raw bytes.)  
    ///
    /// StringSockets are thread safe.  This means that two or more threads may
    /// invoke methods on a shared StringSocket without restriction.  The
    /// StringSocket takes care of the synchronization.
    /// 
    /// Each StringSocket contains a Socket object that is provided by the client.  
    /// A StringSocket will work properly only if the client refrains from calling
    /// the contained Socket's read and write methods.
    /// 
    /// If we have an open Socket s, we can create a StringSocket by doing
    /// 
    ///    StringSocket ss = new StringSocket(s, new UTF8Encoding());

    ///

    /// successfully written the string to the underlying Socket, or failed in the
